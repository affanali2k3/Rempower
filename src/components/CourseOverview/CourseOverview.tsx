      <h1>The Comprehensive Maryland Real Estate Prelicensing Program is Broken Up into Two Phases</h1>
      <h2>Phase 1: Get Your Real Estate License</h2>
      <p className="para">
        The purpose of this phase is to get you your Maryland Real Estate License in the quickest and easiest way possible by making sure
        that you pass both the in-classroom and licensure exam the very first time!
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        I have used my experience as real estate instructor for 13+ years, a real estate broker, and more importantly as a new member
        orientation instructor for 5+ years of every new real estate agent in Montgomery County, MD and Washington D.C. to create this
        program.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        This program has been created systematically to break down the material in the simplest manner so that you can easily understand and
        remember it forever! The way that I do this is through the presentation of the material and the additional materials that I provide
        to you.
      </p>
      <h2>Phase 2: Build Your Business</h2>
      <p className="para">
        Unfortunately, the information that you must learn to pass your real estate license exam has nothing to do with the business!

        I personally created this program after 5 years of the same response of students from the New Member Orientation at GCAAR, where I
        was teaching every single new agent in Montgomery, MD and Washington D.C.{" "}

              Psychology of the Buyer: You need to understand how a buyer thinks and how they decide and make decisions. If you do not know
              this you will never understand how to work with them. I walk you through the entire process of helping them buy a home. Each
              buyer has expectations that you have to learn how to manage. We will teach you exactly how to get them focused so they can get
              to the sale as quickly as possible. This will save you so much time and gas money!

              Psychology of the Seller: Selling a home is much different than buying a home and I explain to you the issues that come up and

              homes. We will show you how to get your clients to understand the market price of their home and how to manage their
              expectations on repairs. This is one that you will want to re-watch again!
